# Squid Game Text-Based Simulation (C++)

A text-based game simulation inspired by *Squid Game*, built in C++.  
This project focuses on game logic, state management, and rule-based NPC behavior rather than graphics.

---

## Overview

The goal of this project was to design an interactive simulation that models the progression, tension, and decision-making found in the Squid Game series using a text-based interface. The game emphasizes player choice, consequences, and evolving game states.

## Features

- Multiple game modes inspired by Squid Game challenges
- Rule-based, AI-like NPC behavior that reacts to player actions
- Reputation system that influences outcomes and interactions
- Structured game flow with clear state transitions
- Text-based interface to keep focus on logic and systems

---

## Technical Focus

- Language: **C++**
- Programming concepts:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (classes, encapsulation)
  - Control flow and game-state management
  - Conditional logic and branching outcomes
  - Modular file structure across multiple `.cpp` files
